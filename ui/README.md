# OEE Platform UI

This is the React-based frontend for the OEE Monitoring Platform.

## Structure
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components (buttons, forms, etc.)
- `src/pages/` — Top-level screens (Dashboard, Timeline, Manual Event Input, etc.)
- `src/styles/` — Global and modular styles

## Getting Started
```bash
cd ui
npm start
```

## Tech Stack
- React (TypeScript, PWA)
- (Planned) Tailwind CSS or Material UI
- Modern, modular structure for rapid feature delivery
