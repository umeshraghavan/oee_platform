# Vercel Reference App UX/UI Review & Recommendations

## 1. Navigation & Layout
- **Reusable:** The app’s top navigation bar and sidebar offer a clear, modern structure. This can be reused for the OEE platform, adapting menu items to include “Operator Dashboard,” “Timeline,” “Reports,” and “Supervisor View.”
- **Recommendation:** Keep the navigation minimal for operators; expand for supervisors/managers.

## 2. Operator Actions & Job Screens
- **Reusable:** The “Start Job,” “Break,” and “Finish” action buttons are prominent and easy to use—ideal for operator-first design.
- **Adaptation:** Ensure these actions are context-aware (e.g., disable “Start” if a job is running). Add visual feedback for state changes.
- **Timeline:** If the current app includes a timeline or activity log, reuse this for job flow visualization.

## 3. Job/Production Dashboard
- **Reusable:** Any dashboard showing job status, active jobs, or recent activity can be adapted for OEE, focusing on key metrics (OEE %, downtime, etc.).
- **Adaptation:** Add OEE-specific KPIs, machine status, and quick filters (by shift, machine, etc.).

## 4. Reporting & Analytics
- **Reusable:** If the app has reporting/analytics screens, these can be adapted for OEE metrics (Availability, Performance, Quality).
- **Missing:** For the MVP, ensure there’s a simple report generator for OEE % and export options (PDF/CSV).
- **Recommendation:** Plan for future heatmaps, trend graphs, and anomaly alerts in later phases.

## 5. Supervisor/Multi-Machine Views
- **Missing:** If not present, you’ll need a supervisor dashboard for multi-job/multi-machine overview and alerts.
- **Recommendation:** Design this to scale for multiple plants/machines, with role-based access.

## 6. General UX Strengths
- Clean, modern UI with good use of whitespace and clear action buttons.
- Responsive design—works well on tablets and desktops.
- Consistent color scheme and typography.

## 7. Gaps & To-Add
- **Role-based access control**: Not visible in the reference app—add for supervisors vs. operators.
- **Machine configuration**: Needed for different machine types (Heidelberg, Komori).
- **Conflict resolution UI**: Visual cues for conflict between manual and sensor data.
- **Anomaly logging/alerts**: For missing data or mismatches.
